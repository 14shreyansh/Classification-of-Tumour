# Data_Classification
The breast cancer database was obtained from Dr. Wolberg’s office at the University of Wisconsin
Hospitals, Madison. Each record here contains values for different morphological and pathological
features of a tumor dissected from any given patient. The class column indicates whether the patient
has been characterized as the benign tumor or a malignant tumor.

Question 1:​ Build a classifier to identify patients with benign or malignant tumor based on the tumor
characteristics

Question 2:​ As an oncologist, you would want to reduce your false positives as well as false
negatives.
          
          a. Identify the number of false positive and false negatives
         
          b. Improve your classification model to reduce patients who are being predicted as having
             benign tumor but actually have malignant tumor
